# Conflict Resolution AI Tool

An AI-powered conflict resolution platform that helps individuals and teams resolve disputes through guided conversation and intelligent analysis.

## Project Overview

This application is designed to facilitate conflict resolution between two parties using AI-mediated conversations and analysis. The platform provides a structured approach to understanding conflicts and generating actionable solutions.

## Application Flow

### 1. User Authentication & Conflict Creation

- User logs into the platform
- User is prompted to create a new conflict case
- User provides a detailed description of the conflict situation

### 2. Participant Invitation

- User adds the other party involved in the conflict
- Participant is invited via email or other contact method
- System generates a unique access link for the second participant

### 3. AI-Guided Questioning (Conflict Creator)

- AI conducts an interview with the conflict creator
- Questions are designed to understand:
  - Background and context of the conflict
  - Personal perspective and feelings
  - Desired outcomes and goals
  - Previous attempts at resolution

### 4. Participant Engagement

- Second participant receives email invitation with access link
- Participant accesses dedicated webpage for their session
- AI conducts similar guided questioning session
- Questions are tailored based on information from the first participant

### 5. AI Analysis & Resolution Generation

- AI processes both parties' responses
- Analyzes patterns, perspectives, and underlying issues
- Generates comprehensive conflict analysis including:
  - **Root Cause Analysis**: Why the conflict occurred
  - **Perspective Mapping**: Understanding each party's viewpoint
  - **Common Ground**: Areas of agreement and shared interests
  - **Actionable Steps**: Concrete recommendations for resolution
  - **Communication Strategies**: Suggested approaches for moving forward

### 6. Resolution Delivery

- Both parties receive the AI-generated analysis and recommendations
- Platform provides tools for continued dialogue if needed
- Progress tracking and follow-up suggestions
